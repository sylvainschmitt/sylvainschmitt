### ðŸ‘‹ Hi there!

**I'm Sylvain**, a postdoctoral researcher in tropical tree ecology and evolution. I did a PhD on genotype-environment interactions in shaping intraspecific variability in tropical tree species, and explored its impact on the origin and maintenance of biodiversity. I am currently involved in the TreeMutation project which focuses on mutations in the canopy of tropical trees. More info at https://sylvainschmitt.netlify.app/.
