### ðŸ‘‹ Hi there!

**I'm Sylvain**, soon to be an ecologist at CIRAD (https://www.cirad.fr), a French research center working with developing countries on environmental and development issues. 
I am currently conducting research into modeling the joint effect of climate change and anthropogenic disturbance on the dynamics of Amazonian tropical forests.
